## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, PCA
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Classification Report
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Interactive data profiling with ydata-profiling

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient information related to cardiovascular health indicators.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
